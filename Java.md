# Java

## Variables

```java
//width of an Int = 32 (4 bytes)
int myIntValue = 5;
//width of a float = 32 (4 bytes)
float myFloatValue = 5f;
//width of a double = 64 (8 bytes)
double myDoubleValue = 5d;
```

​		Can cast an int, or double as another type by using () with the data type between them.

​	Float has 7 digits of precision
​	Double has 16 digits of precision. Is actually faster on modern systems. Inbuilt Java functions just Double more often, and it is more precise.
